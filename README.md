# Introduction to System Programming in Linux
Welcome to the [Introduction to System Programming in Linux](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOBLIyu46FvPlBaAdPrzLqOx6O5rowI9I) course on YouTube! This course is designed to help you understand the basics of system programming in Linux and how to write efficient programs using system calls in C.

## Course Overview
This course covers the following topics:

- An introduction to Linux system programming
- Understanding the Linux kernel and system calls
- File I/O and process management in Linux
- Partion table
- And more.

## Assignments
To enhance your learning experience, we have included five assignments that will help you implement the Femto shell using C system calls. The assignments are as follows:

1. **Assignment 1:** Implement a basic shell program that can echoes any command entered by the user.

2. **Assignment 2:** Extend the basic shell to support some Unix Utilities (pwd, echo, cp, mv).

3. **Assignment 3:** Add support for external commands and local & environment variables .

4. **Assignment 4:** Implement a program similar to ``fdisk -l``.

5. **Assignment 5:** Implement a program for ``ls`` command.

## Course Requirements
To follow along with this course, you will need:

- A basic understanding of C programming language
- A Linux machine or virtual machine (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.) to run the code examples and complete the assignments
- A text editor (e.g., Vim, Emacs, Nano, etc.) to write C code
- A terminal emulator (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Konsole, xterm, etc.) to compile and run the code

## Conclusion
We hope you find this course useful and informative. By the end of this course, you should be able to write efficient system programs using C system calls in Linux. Good luck and have fun!
